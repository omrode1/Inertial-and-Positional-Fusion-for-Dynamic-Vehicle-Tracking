# Project Description

## Overview

The Integrated Vehicle Dynamics Monitoring System is a project that combines the power of sensor fusion technology to monitor and analyze the dynamics of a vehicle in real-time. The integration of the BNO055 inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a GPS module provides comprehensive insights into the vehicle's orientation, motion, and speed.

## Key Features

- **BNO055 IMU:** Measures orientation angles (yaw, pitch, roll) with high precision.
- **GPS Module:** Provides accurate speed and positional data for enhanced analysis.
- **Sensor Fusion:** Integrates data from multiple sensors for a holistic view of vehicle dynamics.

## Applications

1. **Performance Optimization:** Fine-tune suspension setups for superior handling.
2. **Real-world Monitoring:** Track and analyze vehicle performance in real-world driving scenarios.
3. **Research and Development:** Serve as a valuable tool for researchers and engineers in the automotive field.
