# Inertial-and-Positional-Fusion-for-Dynamic-Vehicle-Tracking
The Integrated Vehicle Dynamics Monitoring System is a cutting-edge project that leverages the power of sensor fusion technology. Combining the precision of the BNO055 inertial measurement unit (IMU) with the positional accuracy of a GPS module, this system offers comprehensive insights into a vehicle's dynamic behavior.

The BNO055 sensor provides real-time data on orientation, allowing for precise measurement of roll, pitch, and yaw angles. Simultaneously, the GPS module contributes accurate speed and positional information. Through sophisticated integration algorithms, the project calculates dynamic weight transfer, load transfer, and vehicle speed, providing a holistic view of the vehicle's performance during various maneuvers.

Applications range from optimizing suspension setups for superior handling to monitoring vehicle health and performance in real-world driving scenarios. This project is ideal for enthusiasts, engineers, and researchers seeking a deeper understanding of vehicle dynamics through advanced sensor technology.
