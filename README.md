# Inertial-and-Positional-Fusion-for-Dynamic-Vehicle-Tracking
The Integrated Vehicle Dynamics Monitoring System is a cutting-edge project that leverages the power of sensor fusion technology. Combining the precision of the BNO055 inertial measurement unit (IMU) with the positional accuracy of a GPS module, this system offers comprehensive insights into a vehicle's dynamic behavior.
